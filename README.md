Work In Progress - an implementation of
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
Chapter 4 in Ocaml.

I decided to implement section 4.3 (a non-deterministic evaluator) in a statically typed
language to aid my understanding of the continuations used to implement backtracking.
